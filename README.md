oasis is a small linux system

# Principles

* Binaries should be linked statically. This is made possible by lightweight
  system components like musl libc, and a central source repository to keep
  track of system-wide dependencies.
* Software components should be built in a generic way that allows the user to
  easily customize and/or modify as needed.
* Sources can be referenced through a URL or git submodule, but not included
  directly in the oasis repository. This way, users only need to download the
  sources they are interested in.
* `/etc` directory should be simple enough for system administrators to
  understand in its entirety and customize appropriately.
